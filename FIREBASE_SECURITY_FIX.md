# Firebase Security Rules Fix

The error "failed to update problem status" is likely caused by Firebase Firestore security rules blocking write operations. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Update Firestore Security Rules

1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/leettracker-12844)
2. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
3. Replace the current rules with these secure rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // User progress can only be read/written by the user who owns it
    match /userProgress/{progressId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        (progressId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*') ||
         resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid);
    }

    // Notes can only be read/written by the user who owns them
    match /userNotes/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Alternative - Test Mode (Temporary)

If you want to test quickly, you can temporarily enable test mode:

1. In Firestore Database → **Rules** tab
2. Click **Start in test mode** (this allows all reads/writes for 30 days)
3. Click **Publish**

⚠️ **Warning**: Test mode allows anyone to read/write to your database. Only use this for development and switch to secure rules before production.

## Step 3: Verify Authentication

Make sure you're properly signed in:

1. Check that you're logged in to the app
2. Open browser console (F12) and check for authentication errors
3. Verify your user ID is being passed correctly

## Step 4: Test the Fix

1. After updating the rules, try marking a problem as solved
2. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
3. The improved error handling will now show specific error details

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

- **Solution**: Update security rules as shown above

### Issue 2: "User not authenticated"

- **Solution**: Make sure you're signed in with Google

### Issue 3: "Document path invalid"

- **Solution**: Check that the user ID and problem ID are valid

### Issue 4: "Quota exceeded"

- **Solution**: Check your Firebase usage limits

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify User Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in
3. **Check Firestore Rules**: Make sure they allow the operation
4. **Test with Console**: Try writing directly from Firebase Console

## Security Rules Explanation

The rules above ensure:

- ✅ Users can only access their own data
- ✅ Progress documents are protected by user ID
- ✅ Authentication is required for all operations
- ✅ Proper validation of document ownership

## Production Security

For production, consider these additional security measures:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // User progress with additional validation
    match /userProgress/{progressId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        progressId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*') &&
        request.resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid;
    }

    // Rate limiting (optional)
    match /userProgress/{progressId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        progressId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*') &&
        request.resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid &&
        request.time < resource.data.lastWrite + duration.value(1, 's');
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Test

To quickly test if the issue is resolved:

1. Update the security rules
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. Try marking a problem as solved
4. Check if the progress appears in the Tracker page

If you're still having issues, check the browser console for the detailed error messages that are now being logged.
